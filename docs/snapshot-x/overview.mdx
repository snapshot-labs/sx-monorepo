## What's Snapshot X?

**Snapshot X** is an onchain voting protocol. Technically speaking, it's a set of modular smart-contracts that interact with each other to do all the book-keeping. The difference with the original [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) is that Snapshot X is **fully onchain**. What this means is:

* **The protocol is censorship resistant**: Anyone can cast a vote. The protocol runs without any reliance on offchain or centralized services which have the power to censor votes. \[1]
* **Voting power is computed onchain**: The voting logic is fully onchain and auditable so you can be sure of the logic used to compute voting power and decide on the outcome of proposals.
* **The execution is trustless**: Proposal transactions are automatically executed following the passing of a proposal. Say you create a new proposal which, if it passes, will transfer 1ETH to `vitalik.eth`. If the proposal passes, the 1ETH will automatically get sent to `vitalik.eth`, without any further human action needed.

<Info>
Snapshot can be found on EVM-chains and on Starknet. Both the [EVM implementation](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/sx-evm) and the [Cairo implementation](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/sx-starknet) are open source. The Starknet's specific details can be found on [this dedicated page](protocol/starknet-specifics).

\[1] We note that there are in fact offchain services (eg the relayer Mana) built for use with Snapshot X, but these are not mandatory and therefore cannot lead to censorship.
