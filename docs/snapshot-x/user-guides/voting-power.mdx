## Why do I have 0 voting power?

There are a few reasons why you might have 0 voting power on Snapshot:

* **No required assets:** You might not hold the necessary assets or meet the criteria based on the voting strategies used by the space. Each space can have different requirements.
* **Delegation required:** For some tokens (like those using ERC-20 Votes), you need to delegate your tokens to gain voting power.
* **Proposal start requirements:** Voting power is determined at the time a proposal starts. If you didn't meet the requirements when the proposal started, you won't have voting power for that proposal.

You can check your current voting power on the space's proposals page to see if you meet the criteria.

## Why do I need to wait for my voting power to be collected from Ethereum?

If you see the message "Please allow a few minutes for the voting power to be collected from Ethereum," it means your space uses a voting strategy that requires data from another blockchain. This process takes about 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, the state is sent from the other chain to the current space chain, where your voting power is verified using storage proofs. Please be patient, and you'll soon be able to see your voting power and cast your vote.
