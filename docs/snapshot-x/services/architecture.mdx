To enhance the user experience of interacting with the protocol, we offer a number of additional off-chain services. All of these products are fully open source in the [Snapshot Labs Github organization](https://github.com/snapshot-labs). These are all completely optional and therefore do not introduce any censorship concerns. 

* [**SX UI**](ui)**:** An easy to use interface for interacting with the protocol. 
* [**SX API**](api)**:** A fast and efficient indexer for all the protocol data. 
* [**SX.js**](sx.js)**:** A Typescript SDK that can be used to build 3rd Party Integrations with the protocol.  
* [**Mana**](mana)**:** A meta-transaction relayer that can provide a way for proposal creation and vote costs to be sponsored.
