**Snapshot X** is a fully onchain voting protocol deployed on EVM chains and Starknet. It consists of modular smart contracts that handle proposal creation, voting, and execution without reliance on any centralized service.

Key properties:

- **Censorship resistant:** the protocol runs entirely onchain with no centralized dependencies.
- **Onchain voting power:** voting logic is fully onchain and auditable.
- **Trustless execution:** proposal transactions are automatically executed when a proposal passes.

Both the [EVM implementation](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/sx-evm) and the [Starknet implementation](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/sx-starknet) are open source.

## Services

To enhance the user experience of interacting with the protocol, Snapshot Labs provides a number of additional offchain services. All are fully open source and completely optional - they do not introduce any censorship concerns.

- [**API**](api): A fast indexer for all protocol data.
- [**SX.js**](sx.js): A TypeScript SDK for building integrations with the protocol.
- [**UI**](ui): An interface for interacting with the protocol.
- [**Mana**](mana): A meta-transaction relayer that sponsors proposal creation and vote costs.
