A proposal is the key element of the voting system. It presents a change suggestion related to a specific organization and enables eligible users to cast their vote.

A specific [voting system](../proposals/voting-types) (single choice, weighted, quadratic, and others) can be selected individually for each proposal.

Voting power for each user is calculated on the basis of the voting strategies selected in the [space settings](voting-strategies).

## Who can create a proposal?

Space [controller](spaces/space-roles),[ admins](spaces/space-roles), [authors](spaces/space-roles), and users who are eligible according to the [proposal validation](validation-strategies) strategies defined in the space settings.

<Warning>
**Proposal limit**

Each space has a limit on the number of proposals that can be created daily and monthly. For more details have a look at [#proposals-limitations](#proposals-limitations).
</Warning>

## Create a proposal

1. Head to the space which you wish to create your proposal for.
2. Connect with the wallet provider - make sure the connected wallet is **where you hold the tokens relevant** to the specific space.
3.  Click the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the space page to start a new proposal:

4.  The proposal editor opens with a two-column layout. On the left, fill in the following fields:\
    \- **Title** (required)\
    \- **Body** (optional, markdown supported - you can switch between markdown and visual editor)\
    \- **Discussion** link (optional)\
    \- **Execution** (if the space has a treasury configured)\
    \
    On the right sidebar, configure:\
    \- **Voting system** (e.g. Basic voting, Single choice, Weighted, etc.)\
    \- **Choices** (pre-filled with For / Against / Abstain for basic voting)\
    \- **Labels** (if the space has labels configured)\
    \- **Timeline:** set the start and end dates for voting. Make sure you allow enough time for users to vote.

5. Click `Publish` in the top-right corner - and that's it! You can see your proposal in the proposals list on the space page.

## **Snapshot block number**

When you create a proposal by default the **snapshot block number** will be populated with the latest block synced from our node.

<Warning>
The voting power of each user will be calculated for the **state of the blockchain at this specific snapshot**. It means that if the user acquires required tokens **after** the proposal has been created, they will not be taken into account for their voting power calculation.
</Warning>

### Proposals limitations

* Each proposal's description is limited to **10,000 characters**. With the [Snapshot Pro](spaces/pro) plan, the limit increases to **50,000 characters**.
* One address can have a maximum of **10 active proposals at a time**, across multiple spaces.
* Each space has a limit on the number of proposals created daily and monthly:

| Space status                     | Daily proposal limit | Monthly proposal limit |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Pro](spaces/pro)    | 100                  | 500                    |
| [Verified](spaces/get-verified/) | 10                   | 50                     |
| Unverified                       | 3                    | 15                     |
| Flagged                          | 1                    | 5                      |
