**This handbook uses terms like** [**Voting**](#user-content-fn-1) **and** [**Validation Strategies**](#user-content-fn-2)**,** [**Voting types**](#user-content-fn-3)**.** \

👉 [Voting strategies](../../voting-strategies)\
👉 [Validation strategies](../../validation-strategies)\
👉 [Voting t](../../../proposals/voting-types)[ypes](../../../proposals/voting-types)\
\
We also recommend going through the entire [Spaces](../) guide to get acquainted with the process of [creating a Space](../create/) and updating its [settings](../settings).
</Info>

This section will help you **combine Voting types, Validation, and Voting strategies** based on your organization's needs. We will look into:

* [Most common configurations](most-common)
* [Voting threshold](voting-threshold)
* [Anti-whale solutions](anti-whale)
* [Sybil resistance mechanisms, scam & spam prevention](sybil-resistance-scam-and-spam-prevention)
* [Delegation setups](delegation)
* [Liquidity / staking pool token voting](liquidity-staking-pool)
* [NFT voting](nft-voting/)
* [Custom calculations](custom-calculations)

If none of the above are a good fit for your Space, we encourage you to use the **Search** feature of this documentation with the **Lens** option selected to ask a question and receive a human-friendly answer :wink:
