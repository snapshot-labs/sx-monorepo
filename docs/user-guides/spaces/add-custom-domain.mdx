title: "Add a custom domain"
---

Use a custom domain to host your Snapshot space directly on your own URL. Your community will see only your space with your logo and colors matching your brand for a fully branded governance experience.

### Examples

More than 200 DAOs already use custom domains for their governance, such as:

[vote.worldlibertyfinancial.com](https://vote.worldlibertyfinancial.com)\
[governance.starknet.io](https://governance.starknet.io)\
[vote.convexfinance.com](https://vote.convexfinance.com)

### Requirements

This feature is available with the [Snapshot Pro](pro) plan. Once your subscription is active, follow the setup process below.

### Setup steps

#### 1. Create a CNAME record

Log in to your domain provider and add a new CNAME record:

* **Host:** the domain or subdomain you want to use (e.g., `vote.convexfinance.com`)
* **Points to:** `cname.snapshot.box`

#### 2. Contact us

After you have created the CNAME record, contact us via the messenger on our [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.box) to confirm your custom domain. We'll handle the rest and activate your branded Snapshot space.

<Warning>
**Migrating from a whitelabel**

Effective August 15, 2025, whitelabel (custom domain) functionality is a Snapshot Pro feature. To continue using your custom domain, please subscribe to [Snapshot Pro](https://snapshot.box/#/pro). If you prefer to disable your custom domain, remove the CNAME record from your DNS provider and consider setting up a redirect from your old domain to your main website.
