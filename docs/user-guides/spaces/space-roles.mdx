## What is a role?

A role is a set of permissions related to managing your space and its proposals which an account (wallet address) can be granted.

## Role permissions

### Controller

The controller has **full control over the space settings** including managing the list of admins.

### Admin

An admin can **edit space settings** with the exception of the list of admin users and **archive proposals.**

### Moderator

A moderator can manage proposals within the space and create new ones.

### Author

An author can **create proposals** regardless of their voting power and the proposal validation strategy.

## Assign a role to a user

### Controller

The controller is first assigned during the process of space creation. By default, it is the ENS domain controller.

There can be only **one controller** per space and it can be updated **only by the ENS owner.**

To view or update the controller, go to your space **Settings** and select the **Controller** tab:

Click the edit icon next to the controller address, paste the address of the new controller, and confirm. This will trigger your wallet and ask you to sign a **transaction with a gas fee.**

### Admins, moderators, and authors

To manage members, go to your space **Settings** and select the **Members** tab.

You can add addresses and choose their applicable role from the dropdown:
