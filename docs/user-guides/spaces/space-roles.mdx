## What is a role?

Snapshot spaces use a hierarchical role system to manage governance and participation. The four main roles are Controller, Admin, Moderator, and Author, each with specific permissions.

## Role permissions

### Controller

The **Controller** is the highest authority, limited to a single entity per space. They have full control, including adding or removing admins, editing space settings, canceling proposals, and publishing proposals. Controllers can be represented by smart contract wallets like Safe, and sometimes the space itself serves as the Controller.

### Admin

**Admins** can edit space settings, cancel proposals, and publish proposals but cannot add or remove other admins.

### Moderator

**Moderators** can cancel proposals and publish proposals but cannot edit settings or manage admins.

### Author

**Authors** can publish proposals without needing voting power or meeting proposal validation requirements. They have no other administrative permissions.

<Info>
On Snapshot X there is only one role: the Controller. The Controller can change settings and cancel proposals.

## Assign a role to a user

### Controller

The controller is first assigned during the process of space creation. By default, it is the ENS domain controller.

There can be only **one controller** per space and it can be updated **only by the ENS owner.**

To view or update the controller, go to your space **Settings** and select the **Controller** tab:

Click the edit icon next to the controller address, paste the address of the new controller, and confirm. This will trigger your wallet and ask you to sign a **transaction with a gas fee.**

### Admins, moderators, and authors

To manage members, go to your space **Settings** and select the **Members** tab.

You can add addresses and choose their applicable role from the dropdown:
