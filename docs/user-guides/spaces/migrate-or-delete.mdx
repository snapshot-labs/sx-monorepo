<Info>
Currently, migrating spaces still requires some manual effort.

## Delete a space

If you are a space controller you can delete the space through Snapshot's interface directly.

<Warning>
Deleting a space **cannot be reversed** and you will **not be able to create a new space** with the same ENS domain name.
</Warning>

Go to your space **Settings** and select the **Advanced** tab:

Scroll down to the **Danger zone** section and click **Delete space**:

Confirm the space deletion with the **space ID** and sign a message in your wallet.

## Migrate a space

Create a proposal on the source space as well as on the target space with the title "Migrate this space" from the respective controllers of the spaces (the Ethereum address that is registered in the `snapshot` ENS text record).
