## Delete a space

If you are a space controller you can delete the space through Snapshot's interface directly.

<Warning>
Deleting a space **cannot be reversed** and you will **not be able to create a new space** with the same ENS domain name.
</Warning>

Go to your space **Settings** and select the **Advanced** tab:

Scroll down to the **Danger zone** section and click **Delete space**:

Confirm the space deletion with the **space ID** and sign a message in your wallet.

## Migrate a space

If you have an existing Snapshot space and need to move it to a new ENS domain, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Create a new space

Set up a fresh Snapshot space under your new ENS domain. If you want to keep the same configuration (profile, voting strategies, etc.), get in touch once the new space is created. The team will copy over those settings so you don't have to reconfigure everything.

### Step 2: We migrate your existing activity

The Snapshot team will manually migrate all proposals, votes, followers, and related data from your old space, ensuring your community doesn't lose any activity. When the migration is complete, links to your old space or proposals will automatically redirect users to the new ENS domain.

Contact our support on [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.box/en/) to request a migration.
