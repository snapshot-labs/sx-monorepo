title: "Cover image size"
---

Cover images in Snapshot spaces are displayed at a dynamic size that can change depending on the screen size, so the top and bottom may be cut off. We recommend using a **1500 x 400** pixel image and keeping important elements away from the edges. You can preview how the cover will look in your space settings before saving.
