<Info>
If you want to experiment with Snapshot before creating a real space, try [testnet.snapshot.box](https://testnet.snapshot.box) — a Sepolia testnet playground for testing.
</Info>

To create a space, go to [snapshot.box/#/create](https://snapshot.box/#/create) or click the **+** button in the left sidebar. You will be guided through the following steps.

### 1. Profile

Set up your space's identity. Enter a **name** (required) and optionally add a description, avatar, cover image, categories, voting power symbol, and social accounts (website, GitHub, X, Farcaster, CoinGecko).

You can update this information at any time after creating the space.

### 2. Domain name

Select your space's domain name. You need an ENS name on Ethereum mainnet or a web3 domain name on a mainnet network. Your available domains will be listed automatically.

If you don't have a domain, you can register a new ENS name or attach a custom domain. By default, the space's controller is the domain owner.

### 3. Network

### 4. Voting strategies

Choose how your users' votes are counted through a set of strategies. You can pick from common strategies like **ERC-20**, **ERC-20 Votes**, **ERC-721**, or **ERC-1155**, or browse the full list to add a custom strategy.

<Info>
Each strategy takes into account the assets that belong to the voting address **at the time of proposal creation**, not at the time of voting.

### 5. Proposal validation

Configure who is allowed to create a proposal. Options include:

* **Only authors can propose** — restrict proposal creation to designated authors
* **Basic** — use a minimum score with any strategy to determine eligibility
* **Gitcoin Passport gated** — require users to have a Gitcoin Passport
* **Karma EAS Attestation** — use EAS attestations for eligibility

### 6. Voting settings

Set the **voting delay** (time between proposal creation and voting start) and the **voting period** (how long voting remains open). If left empty, the proposal author will be able to set these values.

### 7. Members

Assign roles and permissions to your space members. Available roles:

* **Admin** — can modify settings, manage proposals, and create proposals
* **Moderator** — can manage proposals and create proposals
* **Author** — can create proposals without validation

Once everything is configured, click **Create space** to finalize.
