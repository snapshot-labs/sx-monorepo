Organizations can create multiple spaces and link them together. Adding a sub-space displays its proposals within your space. This is useful for enforcing different space settings for proposal creation, voting, and execution. For example, instead of having to change the space settings each time you create a proposal, you could create additional spaces with some of your most frequently used settings.

### Setup

You can configure sub-spaces in the **Advanced** tab of your space settings:

1. Go to your space **Settings** and select the **Advanced** tab.
2. Set a **Main space** to indicate the parent space of the current space.
3. Use the **Sub-space(s)** field to add child spaces, then click **Add space**.

To make the relationship visible on both sides, the sub-space also needs to add your space as its main space in its own settings. Once configured on both sides, the sub-spaces will be displayed on the space overview page.

### Limits
- A space can add up to 16 sub-spaces
