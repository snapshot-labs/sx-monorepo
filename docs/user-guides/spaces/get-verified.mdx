## Verification for legitimacy

Space verification is a process of checking if the space is real and can be trusted. 

Verified spaces have a special badge next to their name, as shown in the screenshot below.

<Info>
Don't worry if you voted on a proposal of a fake space — signing a message doesn't cause any implications for you.

## How to get your space verified?

Make sure to follow all steps from the checklist below:

* Space has an **avatar** image uploaded
* Space has a minimum threshold for **proposal validation** (or limited to authors)
* There are at least **5 closed proposals**
* A **link** from the official website, the **GitHub** organization or a **tweet** to confirm the ownership of the Snapshot space
* Space is not using a testnet or network that has no recognition
* **Ask to get verified** by contacting our support on [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.box/en/)

Verification process can last up to 72 hours.

<Info>
Verification status is valid as long as the space **meets all requirements.**
