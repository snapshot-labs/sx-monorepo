## Verification for legitimacy

Space verification is a process of checking if the space is real and can be trusted. 

Verified spaces have a special badge next to their name, as shown in the screenshot below.

<Info>
Don't worry if you voted on a proposal of a fake space - signing a message doesn't cause any implications for you.

## How to get your space verified?

To get your space verified on Snapshot, ensure it meets the following criteria:

* Space has an **avatar** image uploaded
* Space has a **description**
* There is at least **1 proposal**
* The space has at least **5 followers**
* There are at least **10 votes** across proposals
* A **treasury** is configured
* **Ownership verification** through an official website, GitHub organization, or a tweet linking to the Snapshot space

Once your space fulfills these requirements, contact our support on [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.box/en/) to request verification. The review process may take up to 72 hours.

<Info>
Verification status is valid as long as the space **meets all requirements.**
