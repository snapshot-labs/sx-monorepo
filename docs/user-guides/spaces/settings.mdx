## Voting strategies

Specify how voting power should be calculated by adding up to 6 strategies. Select a network and add strategies from the available list. Voting power is cumulative across strategies.

To learn more about strategies, head to [voting-strategies.md](../voting-strategies).

## Members

Assign roles and permissions to your space members:

* **Admin:** can modify settings, manage proposals, and create proposals
* **Moderator:** can manage proposals and create proposals
* **Author:** can create proposals without validation

Head to [space-roles.md](space-roles) to learn more about each role.

## Proposal

Configure proposal guidelines, templates, and validation. The proposal validation determines who is allowed to create a proposal.

### Proposal validation

To validate if someone can post a proposal, you can use the basic validation which checks voting power against a minimum threshold, or restrict proposals to authors only.

To learn what a validation is head to [validation-strategies.md](../validation-strategies).

## Voting

Set the **voting delay** (time between proposal creation and the start of voting) and the **voting period** (duration that voting remains open).

Configure **quorum** (the amount of voting power required for a proposal to pass), **type** (voting system), **privacy**, and **vote validation**.

### Shielded voting

You can enable shielded voting if you want to enable partial privacy and reduce voter apathy. Powered by Shutter, it uses threshold encryption so that voters' choices are private during the voting period and revealed when the proposal closes.

To enable it, select **Shutter** in the **Privacy** dropdown on the Voting tab.
