title: "What is a space?"
---

You can think of a space as an organization's **account** on Snapshot which can be viewed by anyone visiting the platform. It serves as a hub for all proposals related to the organization and a source of information for the users.

Moreover space allows its organization to manage the roles of organization members and customize the proposal and voting settings.

<Info>
Please note that any updates will not affect proposals which already exist, only the new ones will be affected. For more details have a look at the [settings.md](settings) section.

### How to access a space?

Spaces are listed on the **Explore** page at [https://snapshot.box](https://snapshot.box) and can be filtered by protocol, network, and category. You can search for a space by name using the search bar. You can access a space directly through a link that includes the ENS name (e.g. [https://snapshot.box/#/s:vanilladao.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:vanilladao.eth)). It is also possible to define a **custom domain name** for your space.

### Proposal search and filtering

You can browse through all of a space's proposals on the **Proposals** page. Use the **Status** dropdown to filter by pending, active, or closed proposals. If the space uses labels, you can also filter by **Labels**.

### Following a space

If you want quick access to a space you can follow it from the explore page or through the space's page by clicking the **Follow** button. It will create a shortcut for the space on the left sidebar.

### Space page

The space overview page displays the space's cover image, avatar, name, and key stats such as the number of proposals, votes, and followers. Below the header, you can see a summary of recent proposals. The sidebar provides navigation to the space's proposals, leaderboard, delegates, and treasury.
