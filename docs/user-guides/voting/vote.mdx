## Who can vote on proposals?

Eligibility to vote is determined by the voting strategies specified in the space settings, generally requiring users to have a sufficient amount of tokens in their wallet at the time of proposal creation.

### Voting strategies

Each space specifies their [voting strategies](../voting-strategies) in the [space settings](../spaces/settings#voting-strategies). This setup defines whether you are eligible to take part in voting and what your voting power is, calculated at the [snapshot of proposal creation](../create#snapshot-block-number).

In most cases you will be required to hold a sufficient amount of the specified token at the time of proposal creation. If you can't vote, it's likely because you did not hold the required tokens when the proposal was created.

### Voting validation

Another aspect determining whether you are eligible to vote or not is a [voting validation](../validation-strategies) defined by the space. It is a mechanism used to define certain conditions like minimum token balance or also to prevent [Sybil Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). In other words the space owner wants to make sure that you are human and that bot or fake accounts are not used to overrule the outcome of the voting. 

## Cast a vote

1. Click the `Connect wallet` button in the top right corner.
2. Connect with the wallet provider where you hold the tokens relevant for the space you want to vote in.
3. Go to the space page on Snapshot and selected the active proposal you are interested in.
4. Select the option(s) you want to vote for. The [voting systems](../../proposals/voting-types) can differ between individual proposals.
5. Click to `Vote` button and sign the message via your wallet provider when prompted. 
6. You have successfully cast your vote.
