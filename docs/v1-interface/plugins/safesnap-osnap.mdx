“oSnap” is short for Optimistic Snapshot Execution. oSnap lets DAOs propose transactions, do an offchain governance vote, and have the transaction data submitted in a trustless fashion.

### Instructions for using oSnap

![](/images/113.png)

Setting up the oSnap module:

* Create a Safe and Snapshot Space, or connect to your current accounts.
* Go to Safe Apps, install the Zodiac app, and install the oSnap module through Zodiac.
* Set the proposal bond, challenge period, and Snapshot Space.
* Link the oSnap module to your Snapshot Space with SafeSnap.
* Your oSnap module address is added to the SafeSnap plugin configuration to enforce the results of proposals onchain.

Using oSnap with Snapshot:

* Create a proposal and Snapshot vote, along with the transactions to execute if the proposal passes.
* Invite the community to vote on the proposal.
* Once the Snapshot voting period ends, anyone can propose the transactions by posting a bond.
* After the challenge period, execute the transactions onchain through the Snapshot interface.

### Security recommendations

In order to ensure maximal safety we recommend to define several paremeters for your oSnap setup:

* Set a **substantial bond** for an answer
* Select a **long challenge period**
* Set up a **monitoring infrastructure** for proposed transactions
