<Accordion title="I have an issue, where should I report it?">

* Detailed description of the issue: what action were you trying to perform (i.e. casting a vote), what error did you get
* Screenshots - provide the screenshots of the error you are getting

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I get 'Oops, something went wrong!' what should I do?">
We recommend to wait for around 10 minutes and try again. If the error persist, open the console panel (right click with your mouse and click `Inspect` and open the `Console` tab):

* Topic: clear on context when you got the error - Cannot cast a vote - Oops, something went wrong

<Accordion title="I can't follow more than 25 spaces, is that intended?">
Yes. Limiting the number of followed spaces to 25 is one of our anti-scam & -spam measures.

<Accordion title="I'm receiving the error 'The message timestamp is not valid. Please check the clock on your device, and make sure it is set to the correct date and time, and try again'?">
The reason behind this error is that the time configured on your device isn't accurate. [Refer here to troubleshoot](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/discussions/769#discussioncomment-1400619).
