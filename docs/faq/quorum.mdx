## How does quorum work on Snapshot?

In Snapshot, a proposal passes if it has more "For" votes than "Against" votes, and the total of "For" plus "Abstain" plus "Against" votes reaches or exceeds the quorum. In other words, all votes whether they are in favor, against, or abstaining count toward meeting the required participation level. Once that level is met, the proposal's success depends on having a clear majority of "For" votes over "Against".

## How does quorum work on Snapshot X?

In Snapshot X, a proposal passes if it meets two conditions: it must have more "For" votes than "Against" votes, and the total of "For" plus "Abstain" votes must reach or exceed a set quorum. In other words, there needs to be enough overall participation and a clear majority in favor for the proposal to succeed.
