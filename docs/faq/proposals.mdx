## Is it possible to submit proposals programmatically?

Yes, using Snapshot's API or SDK, you can automate proposal submissions. Check the [developer documentation](/tools/snapshot.js) for specific methods and requirements.

## What are the limitations for creating proposals?

Each proposal's description is limited to **10,000 characters**. An address can have up to **10 active proposals** across spaces at any time. Verified spaces can create up to **10 proposals daily** and **50 monthly**, unverified spaces are limited to **3 daily** and **15 monthly**, while flagged spaces can only create **1 daily** and **5 monthly**.

With the [Snapshot Pro](/user-guides/spaces/pro) plan, the character limit increases to **50,000 characters**, and proposal creation limits expand to **100 proposals per day** and **500 per month**.
