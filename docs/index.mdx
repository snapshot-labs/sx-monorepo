## How does it work?

Snapshot’s protocol involves three core elements: spaces, proposals, and votes. A space functions like an organization’s profile, and every proposal and vote is tied to that space. To create a space, the only requirement is to have an ENS domain. Once a space is set up, users can submit proposals and cast their votes on the space’s page. Administrators of the space can tailor the rules for creating proposals and voting by configuring various voting and validation strategies. For instance, a space might require users to hold a minimum of 500 tokens to create a proposal, or it might assign voting power proportionally to the token balance in a user’s wallet.
